        This is the personal website of <span style={{color: "#BDE666"}}> Cole Styron</span>. It isn't much to look at, I'll grant you, but perhaps 
        have a poke around. You might find one or two things of interest if you <i>really look.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        As a <span style={{color: "#FF555D"}}>software engineer</span>, I spend a lot of time communicating with the <span style={{color: "#F6E183"}}>machines</span>. This pastime is not 
        without interest. Perhaps you'd like to give it a try?
